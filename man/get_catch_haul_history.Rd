\title{Find historical catch data from previous years}
\usage{
get_catch_haul_history(
  survey,
  species_codes = NA,
  years = NA,
  station,
  grid_buffer = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{survey}{(character) A character string of the survey you are interested in reivewing. Options are those from public_data$survey, which are "AI", "GOA", "EBS", "NBS", "BSS".}

\item{species_codes}{(numeric) A species code number of a species or species you are specifically interested in reviewing data from. If NA/not entered, the function will return data for all species caught in the haul.}

\item{years}{(numeric) the years you want returned in the output. If years = NA, script will default to the last 10 years. If you would like to see all years, simply choose a large range that covers all years of the survey (e.g., 1970:2030)}

\item{station}{(character) A character string of the current station name (as a grid cell; e.g., "264-85")}

\item{grid_buffer}{(numeric) GOA/AI only. The number of cells around the current station where you would like to see catches from. Typically, use grid_buffer = 3.}
}
\value{
a data.frame of past catches and hauls
}

\examples{
#' # EBS (or NBS) --------------------------------------------------------------

## for one year and only 1 station for all species --------------------------
get_catch_haul_history(
     survey = "EBS",
     years = 2021,
     station = "I-13")

## for default 10 years and only 1 station  for PCOD and walleye pollock ----
get_catch_haul_history(
     species_codes = c(21720, 21740), # pacific cod and walleye pollock
     survey = "EBS",
     station = "I-13")

# AI (or GOA) ---------------------------------------------------------------

## for two specific years and nearby stations -------------------------------
get_catch_haul_history(
      survey = "AI",
      years = c(2016, 2018),
      station = "324-73",
      grid_buffer = 3)

## for default 10 years and nearby stations for all species (a typical use-case) ----
get_catch_haul_history(
     survey = "AI",
     years = NA, # default
     station = "324-73",
     grid_buffer = 3)

## for default 10 years and nearby stations for Bering Flounder (0 results returned!) ---
get_catch_haul_history(
     survey = "AI",
     species_codes = 10140, # Bering flounder which would be VERY unlikely to be found
     years = NA, # default
     station = "324-73",
     grid_buffer = 3)
