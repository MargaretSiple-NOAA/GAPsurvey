\arguments{
\item{VESSEL}{Optional. Default = NA. The vessel number (e.g., 162 for AK Knight, 94 for Vesteraalen). If NA or not called in the function, a prompt will appear asking for this data.}

\item{CRUISE}{Optional. Default = NA. The cruise number, which is usually the year + sequential two digit cruise (e.g., 202101). If NA or not called in the function, a prompt will appear asking for this data.}

\item{HAUL}{Optional. Default = NA. The haul number that you are trying to convert data for (e.g., 3). If NA or not called in the function, a prompt will appear asking for this data.}

\item{MODEL_NUMBER}{Optional. Default = NA. The model number of the Marport sensor (e.g., 123 or 999, you can put in NA or a dummy number here instead of the actual model number without any negative repercussions).}

\item{VERSION_NUMBER}{Optional. Default = NA. The version number of the Marport sensor (e.g., 123 or 999, you can put in NA or a dummy number here instead of the actual version number without any negative repercussions).}

\item{SERIAL_NUMBER}{Optional. Default = NA. The serial number of the Marport sensor (e.g., 123 or 999, you can put in NA or a dummy number here instead of the actual serial number without any negative repercussions).}

\item{path_in}{Optional. The default is the location on the catch computer ("C:/Program Files/Marport Server/Logs/") but any path can be entered.}

\item{path_out}{Optional. The default is the local working directory but can be specified with a string.}

\item{filename_add}{Optional. Default = "new". This string will be added to the name of the outputed file. Here, you can additional information that may make this file helpful to find later.}

\item{quiet}{Optional logical TRUE/FALSE. Default = FALSE. If FALSE, will print a statement or a pop-up window will let the user know where the file has been saved to.}
}
\value{
.BTH and .BTD files to the path_out directory.

\description{
Converts Marport BVDR data (.ted and .tet files from Marport headrope sensor) to .BTD format.  You must first run the BVDR converter program (convert_bvdr.exe) to convert the Marport .bvdr files into .ted and .tet files that can be pulled into R. The BVDR program and instructions can be found in the RACE Survey App.  You will have to create your own .SGT file using the example in the BVDR instruction file with start and end time (be sure to include a carriage return after your (second and) final row of data!), because this is not a file that our current systems creates.  Once you have used the BVDR converter to output the .ted and .tet files you are ready to use the TEDtoBTD() function here!
